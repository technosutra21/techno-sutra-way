# Techno Sutra - Improvements and Enhancements

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the Techno Sutra application, transforming it from a basic prototype with dummy data to a rich, data-driven cyberpunk Buddhist experience.

## Major Improvements Implemented

### 1. CSV Data Integration ✅
**Problem**: The application was using hardcoded dummy data instead of the rich CSV files provided.

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces (`/src/types/sutra.ts`)
- Built custom CSV parsing hook (`/src/hooks/useSutraData.ts`)
- Integrated 4 CSV files:
  - `characters.csv` - Portuguese character data
  - `characters_en.csv` - English character data  
  - `chapters.csv` - Portuguese chapter data
  - `chapters_en.csv` - English chapter data

**Features**:
- Automatic CSV parsing with proper quote handling
- Combined data interface for easy access
- Error handling and loading states
- Multi-language support (PT/EN)

### 2. Enhanced Map Experience ✅
**Improvements**:
- **Fixed Map Styles**: Corrected the swapped map issue (cyberpunk/shadows)
  - "Modo Sombras" now uses `backdrop` style
  - "Modo Cyberpunk" now uses `dataviz` style
  - "Neural Network" uses `streets-v2` style
- **Rich Waypoint Data**: Each point now shows:
  - Character name instead of generic "Capítulo X"
  - Occupation and location information
  - Detailed descriptions from CSV
  - Teaching summaries
- **Enhanced Search**: Search by character name, occupation, location, or chapter

- **Better Visual Organization**: Character cards show meaningful information

### 4. Multi-Language Support ✅
**Features**:
- **Language Context**: React context for language management
- **Translation System**: Comprehensive translation keys
- **Language Switcher**: Easy PT/EN toggle in navigation
- **Data Language Support**: Uses appropriate CSV data based on language

### 5. UI/UX Enhancements ✅
